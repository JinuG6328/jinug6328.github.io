Neural operators have emerged as a powerful tool for learning mappings between function spaces, with direct applications to PDEs. 
These operators provide an elegant solution to reduce the computational burden of infinite/high-dimensional PDE solvers. 
Through their application in BOED, we've developed two approaches:

## DINO (Derivative-informed Neural Operator)

DINO incorporates derivative information. We've trained a model that achieves superior accuracy in both parameter-to-observable maps and their corresponding Jacobians. 
Key features include:<br>
- Efficient surrogate modeling for time-independent PDEs <br>
- Dramatically reduced computational costs while maintaining high accuracy <br>

Our comprehensive analysis and theoretical foundations are detailed in our paper:  
**[Accurate, scalable, and efficient Bayesian optimal experimental design with derivative-informed neural operators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14810)**

## LANO (Latent Attention Neural Operator)

Building on the success of DINO, we developed LANO to address the challenges of sequential Bayesian optimal experimental design. This architecture introduces several innovative features: <br>
- Advanced latent attention mechanism for handling complex temporal dependencies <br>
- Efficient optimization methods for sequential experiments <br>
- Specialized components for capturing biological system dynamics <br>

The theoretical framework and experimental results are extensively documented in our paper:
