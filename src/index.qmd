<!-- ::: {#hero-heading} -->

I am a researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where I apply computational methods to solve scientific problems.


## Education
PhD,  May 2018 -- Dec 2024, Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, US <br>

MS,  Aug 2016 -- May 2018, Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, US <br>

BS,  Mar 2009 -- Feb 2016, Energy Resources Engineering & Computational Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea


## Professional Experience
**Research Intern** | Schlumberger-Doll Research, Cambridge, MA | May 2022 -- Aug 2022 <br>

 - Engineered an innovative automated framework integrating machine learning predictions with uncertainty quantification and actionable model recommendations. <br>

 - Developed a novel weighted out-of-distribution (WOOD) indicator by combining Gaussian parameterization with feature importance analysis using PCA and SHAP methodologies. <br>

**Research Intern** | Schlumberger-Doll Research, Cambridge, MA (Remote) | May 2021 -- Aug 2021 <br>

 - Developed a cement evaluation model using transformer architecture, leveraging synthetic data for pre-training and real-world data for fine-tuning to maintain physical accuracy. <br>

 - Achieved significant performance improvements, reducing regression error mean from 0.13 to 0.07 and standard deviation from 0.32 to 0.25. <br>


## Personal Interests
Outside of research, I enjoy staying active through swimming and kickboxing. 
I'm also passionate about exploring different cuisines and discovering new restaurants.
